# Crime Reporting Cypress System

The Cypress system is an application designed to automate the process of reporting and tracking problems reported on the streets of the City of Toronto. It allows users to submit reports with pinpointed locations on an interactive map and provide specifications surrounding the type of problem. Citizens can submit detailed reports with this information and choose to subscribe to regular notifications regarding the status of the reported problem. Additionally, it provides features such as map exploration for citizens to learn about existing reports, duplicate notifications to reduce redundancy, and user authentication to prevent false reports.
